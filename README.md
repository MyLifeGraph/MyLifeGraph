# MyLifeGraph

Mobile-first foundation for an AI-powered personal coach and life graph product.

The repository currently contains a Flutter web/mobile client, a small FastAPI
AI-service boundary, and Supabase migrations/configuration. The most reliable
way to explore the product today is the Flutter app in mock-data guest mode.

## Current Status

- The Flutter app is the primary user experience.
- Mock/guest mode is the default local path and does not require Supabase keys.
- Supabase Auth and persistence are wired in the app, but a fresh local
  Supabase reset is not yet enough to fully back all app tables.
- The FastAPI service exposes placeholder recommendation endpoints and is ready
  for future model-backed workflows.
- Repository docs and scripts should be treated as the shared team source of
  truth. Do not depend on user-local Codex skills or machine-specific paths.

## Repository Structure

- `apps/mobile` - Flutter app with Riverpod state, GoRouter navigation,
  Supabase boundaries, mock data sources, and FastAPI client boundaries.
- `services/ai_service` - Python FastAPI service for recommendation and future
  ML workflows.
- `supabase` - Supabase config, PostgreSQL migrations, and RLS policies.
- `docs` - Architecture, local development, and Supabase status notes.
- `scripts` - Team-friendly helper scripts for local development.
- `AGENTS.md` - Repo-local instructions for coding agents.

## Quick Start

Prerequisites:

- Flutter SDK available on `PATH`, or set `FLUTTER_BIN=/path/to/flutter`.
- Python 3.11+ if you want to run the AI service or static web fallback.

From a fresh clone:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
scripts/start_frontend.sh
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:7357
```

Use **Continue as guest** in the app. This is the intended local path when no
Supabase credentials are configured.

If Flutter is not on `PATH`:

```bash
FLUTTER_BIN=/path/to/flutter scripts/start_frontend.sh
```

Static build fallback:

```bash
MODE=static scripts/start_frontend.sh
```

Windows PowerShell users can also run:

```powershell
apps\mobile\start_server_7357.ps1
```

## Runtime Configuration

The Flutter app reads runtime values from Dart defines. The repo script maps
matching environment variables into Dart defines:

```env
APP_ENV=development
USE_MOCK_DATA=true
SUPABASE_URL=
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
AI_SERVICE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

Useful examples:

```bash
USE_MOCK_DATA=true scripts/start_frontend.sh
```

```bash
USE_MOCK_DATA=false \
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co \
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key \
scripts/start_frontend.sh
```

Never commit real Supabase keys.

## AI Service

The AI service is optional for the default mock-data app preview.

```bash
cd services/ai_service
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Then check:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/health
```

See `services/ai_service/README.md` for details.

## Supabase

Supabase is the intended auth and persistence backend. The current app supports:

- Guest mode without Supabase.
- Email/password auth through Supabase Auth.
- Google OAuth through Supabase Auth when OAuth is configured.
- Supabase-backed reads/writes for selected feature data when credentials and
  expected tables exist.

Important current caveat: the migrations in this repo create the newer
snake_case life-graph tables, and later harden RLS for app-facing CamelCase
tables only if those tables already exist. A clean local Supabase database may
therefore not contain every table the Flutter app expects.

See `docs/supabase-current-state.md` before changing Supabase schema or relying
on real remote data.

## Verification

Flutter app:

```bash
cd apps/mobile
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter build web --debug --no-wasm-dry-run
```

AI service:

```bash
cd services/ai_service
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/health
```
